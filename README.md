# Sentiment-Analysis
## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis, a technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in text data. By classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral, this project aims to provide insights into public opinions, customer feedback, and social media interactions. The sentiment analysis model is built using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Features
-Data Collection: Gathers text data from various sources such as social media, reviews, or surveys.
-Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares text data for analysis, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removing stop words.
-Model Training: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Deep Learning models) to classify sentiments.
-Evaluation: Assesses the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
-Visualization: Provides visualizations to represent sentiment distribution and analysis results.

##Technologies Used-
Language: python
Libraries: nltk, spaCy, scikit-learn
